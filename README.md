## If you want to participate:
## Setup
### 1. Clone the repo
``git clone https://github.com/MeshSocialNetwork/Website``
### 2. Open your preferred IDE
### 3. Open your terminal and install dependencies
``npm i``
### 4. Start the project
``npm start``
## Workflow
There is a **main** branch, a **dev** (development) branch and other branches are **'featureX'** or **'bugFixY'**. **main** branch is always what is in production, tested and complete.
**'dev'** is the branch closest to **main** but has changes that should be merged to main and deployed next.
## New feature
Anyone who starts working on a new feature should always branch out from **dev**.   
Try not to fix things directly in **dev**, a branch for every bug (unless it's something like a hotfix).
